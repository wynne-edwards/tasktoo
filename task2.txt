Please find all of my prompts below, each line is a different prompt and they are in order.

Create a Java application to read this file and print out the field values.
Please use bufferedReader and FileReader instead.
Change your Java application to only output user-selected fields from that XML file.
Now change it to output the user-selected fields in JSON format.
This code only returns the last value not all of the cases.
Now include enough validation so that your program does not crash if the user types in something unexpected.
Please also check to see if the field the user entered is actually an option.
Now switch to using the SAX XML parser instead.
I get an error with: "String json = convertToJSON(dataList);" which states "dataList cannot be defined as a variable".
private static String convertToJSON(List<Map<String, String>> dataList) { Gives an error of "this must return a result of type string" Please give me the code for an updated function.
Error: "java.lang.IndexOutOfBoundsException: Index -2 out of bounds for length 2" and further errors.
Can you please recreate my code using the SAX parser and all previous steps.
Please give me a a list of all the prompts I used in this chat in order.
